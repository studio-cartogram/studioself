Iâ€™m an independent graphic designer and art director based in Toronto, Canada. I design books, identities, packaging and typefaces for commercial and cultural clients alike. I believe that my best work is the result of dialogue, research and the exploration of new and unexpected forms and ideas. This way of working often leads to ongoing relationships with clients and partners that evolve alongside the work we do together.

I have over 12 years of experience working for large and small clients in many different fields. Most recently I held the position of Design Director at Concrete, where I led branding and packaging projects for a wide range of clients, locally and internationally. Previously I was a founding partner of the studio Way Shape Form, which focused on the design of publications, printed materials and packaging for museums, publishers and record labels. My work has been recognized internationally by organizations like the Type Directors Club (US), Graphis (CH), and the ADCC (CA), and has been included in exhibitions and publications such as Graphic (KR). I hold a BFA in Graphic Design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. If you think that your project could benefit from my involvement, please get in touch.
