Matthew Boyd is a graphic designer and art director, based in Toronto, Canada. I design books, identities, websites and packaging for commercial and cultural clients. My practice is centred around the creation of thoughtful work that is simultaneously rich with detail and easily understood. My process begins with discussion, research and exploration, and always involves close collaboration with my clients and partners. My wish is to work with people who are engaged with their audience so that together we can create work that communicates as clearly as possible.

I have over 12 years of experience, working for large and small clients in many different areas. Most recently I held the position of Design Director at Concrete, where I lead branding and packaging projects for a wide range of clients, always with a focus on critical details, typography and materials. Previously I was a founding partner of the studio Way Shape Form, which focused on the design of publications, printed materials and packaging for museums, publishers and record labels. My work has been recognized internationally by organizations like the Type Directors Club (US), the One Club (US), Graphis (CH), and the ADCC (CAN), and has been included in publications such as Graphic (KOR). I hold a BFA in Graphic Design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

I am always on the look out for new and exciting projects and collaborations. If you think that your project could benefit from my participation in any way, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in contact.
