Book design for *Mark West And Molly Rose*, a collection of photographs by Jeff Barnett- Winsby published by J&L Books. Jeff had been photographing in Lansing Prison for a year when he found out that an inmate had escaped with the help of a social worker who ran a dog rehabilitation program in the prison. John Maynard and Toby Young, under the aliases Mark West and Molly Rose, were captured two weeks later in Tennessee. This book is a collection of his photographs and correspondence with the two lovers, both before and after their escape. 

After designing Jeff’s thesis book for his MFA in Photography from the Rhode Island School of Design, we were astonished to hear about the prison escape by two of his former subjects. So while Jeff corresponded with the John and Toby, and with their approval, we began to create a narrative structure around the projects which surrounded the events of the prison escape. Once we had a substantial framework for a publication, we approached Jason Fulford of J&L who graciously published the final form of this wonderfully bizarre love story.
