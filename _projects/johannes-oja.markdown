Program designed for the memorial service of Johannes Oja, my grandfather, who passed away in 2012. A short biography, in English and Estonian, was folded around the prayer service sheet. My grandfather lead an eventful life. Born in Estonia, he left for Finland during the war where he enlisted in the Finnish army. After emigrating to Sweden where he met his wife Ellen, they eventually settled in Toronto to raise their family. Johannes was a published poet, translated books from Finnish, and was the editor and arts critic for the *Vaba Eestlane* (*Free Estonian*) newspaper. It was an honour to design this small token of remembrance to him.
