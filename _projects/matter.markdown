Naming, identity, signage, printed materials and custom typography for Matter, a contemporary art gallery showcasing emerging talent from around the globe. With a limited budget and the pressure of opening a new gallery in the crowded art market, a typographic identity was proposed to establish a unique tone of voice for the gallery. A very controlled approach using only one typeface and one colour at a time ensured a level of consistency that would be unmistakable. By using repetition and strict, highly structured layouts, the result is primarily typographic but still incredibly expressive. A custom weight of Wilhelm Bilz and Francesco Simoncini’s typeface Life, “Life Thicc” was created by adding a heavy stroke to the existing letterforms, before carefully manipulating them to ensure some consistency with the Roman weight.

Includes stationery, lightbox signage, Risograph printed invitations, and a 16 page saddle stitched exhibition program. Completed in 2017 for Concrete.
