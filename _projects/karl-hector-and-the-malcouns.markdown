Packaging design for Karl Hector and the Malcouns album *Sahara Swing*, released on Now-Again Records. Karl Hector is German producer and guitarist Jay Whitefield (Jan Weissenfeldt), of the Poets of Rhythm and the Whitefield Brothers. Whitefield was influenced by music from across the African diaspora, the experimentalism of Krautrock, and the rough analog sound of the late 60s to early 70s. The “swinging necklace” artwork was equally inspired by the incredible beauty of the vibrant, hand made, cut and paste artwork used on many original African funk records of that era. 

Includes 2×LP and CD. Completed in 2008 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
