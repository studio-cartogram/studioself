Packaging design for Karl Hector and the Malcouns album *Sahara Swing*, released on Now-Again Records. Karl Hector is German producer and guitarist Jay Whitefield (Jan Weissenfeldt), the visionary behind the Poets of Rhythm, the Whitefield Brothers, and the rough analog sound which returned to the funk archetypes of the late 60s to early 70s. Influenced by music from across the African diaspora and the experimentalism of Krautrock, Whitefield formed Karl Hector and the Malcouns with Thomas Myland and Zdenko Curlija, and released *Sahara Swing* in 2008.

Includes 2Ã—LP and CD. Completed in 2008 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
