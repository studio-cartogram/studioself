Record packaging designed for Karl Hector and the Malcouns’ album *Sahara Swing* released on Now-Again Records. Karl Hector is the pseudonym of German producer and guitarist Jay Whitefield (Jan Weissenfeldt) of the Poets of Rhythm and the Whitefield Brothers. Whitefield was influenced by music from across the African diaspora, the experimentalism of Krautrock, and the rough analog sound of the late 60s and early 70s. The “swinging necklace” artwork was equally inspired by the low fidelity beauty of original African funk records of that era, with their vibrant use of colour and unmistakably hand made, cut-and-paste artwork. 

Includes 2 × LP and CD. Completed in 2008 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
