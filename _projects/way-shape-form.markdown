During 2007—2010 small booklets were sent to clients and colleagues as promotional pieces under the name *WSF Editions*, a small self publishing initiative. Mailing materials and a small notecard for personalized messages were created to package the booklets. The seemingly random composition of lettering was taken from an old found sheet of vinyl signage lettering that hung in the Way Shape Form studio for many years.

Includes 4 × 6 inch Gocco printed notecard and rubber stamp with return address. Completed in 2007, with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
