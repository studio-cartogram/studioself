Mailing materials and a notecard created to package small booklets mailed during 2007—2010. The booklets were sent to clients and colleagues as promotional pieces under the name *WSF Editions*, a small self publishing initiative by our studio. The seemingly random composition was taken from a large sheet of half-used vinyl lettering which hung in the Way Shape Form studio for many years.

Includes 4 × 6 inch Gocco printed notecard and a rubber stamp with return address. Completed in 2007 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
