Mailing materials and a small notecard for personalized messages created to package booklets mailed during 2007—2010. The booklets were sent to clients and colleagues as promotional pieces under the name *WSF Editions*, a small self publishing initiative by our studio. The seemingly random composition was taken from a found sheet of vinyl signage lettering that hung in the Way Shape Form studio for many years.

Includes 4 × 6 inch Gocco printed notecard and rubber stamp with return address. Completed in 2007, with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
