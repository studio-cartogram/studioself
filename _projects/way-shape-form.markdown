During 2007—2010 small booklets were sent to clients and colleagues as promotional pieces under the name *WSF Editions*, a small self publishing initiative. Mailing materials and a small notecard with personalized messages were created to package the booklets.

Includes 4 × 6 inch Gocco printed notecard and rubber stamp with return address. Completed in 2007, with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
