Record packaging design for The Heliocentricâ€™s *Sirius B*, the third 12 inch single from their album *Out There*, released on Now-Again Records. The London-based Heliocentrics are centered around drummer Malcolm Catto, and are known for their collaborations with Ethio jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke, jazzman Lloyd Miller and Afro soul Godfather, Orlando Julius. Taking its cue from the title, the artwork is of an astrolabe, an ancient device historically used by astronomers and navigators to identify stars or planets.

Completed in 2008 for Way Shape Form.
