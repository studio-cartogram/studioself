London psychedelic jazz collective The Heliocentrics have their roots in the ‘90s when drummer Malcolm Catto recorded for Mo’Wax and Jazzman. They recorded their breakthrough album for Stones Throw, ‘Out There’ in 2007 and have since become known for their superb collaborations with legends including Ethio jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke, jazzman Lloyd Miller and Afro soul Godfather, Orlando Julius.
