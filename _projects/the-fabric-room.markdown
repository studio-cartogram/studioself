Identity and printed materials for The Fabric Room, a wholesale showroom specializing in high end fabrics and notions sourced from top European mills. The Fabric Room was created after Lida Baday closed her womenswear label in 2014, as a means of making the vast inventory she had amassed over 27 years available to the public. A new brand and typographic voice was created to give the showroom its own identity. By using the Lida Baday archive of photography shot by Chris Nicholls, under the creative direction of Diti Katona, garments which had appeared in previous collections showcase the potential of the fabrics available. The typeface used is an early version of Sawtooth, a display face exploring Fred Smeijersâ€™ approach to letter construction, using stencils as a starting point. 

Completed in 2015 for Concrete, with Diti Katona, photography by Chris Nicholls.
