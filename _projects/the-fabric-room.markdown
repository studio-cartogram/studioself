Identity and printed materials for The Fabric Room, a wholesale showroom specializing in high end fabrics and notions sourced from top European mills. The Fabric Room was created after Lida Baday closed her womenswear label in 2014, as a means of making the vast inventory she had amassed over 27 years available to the public. A new brand and typographic voice was created to give the showroom its own identity. Lida’s extensive photography archive, shot by Chris Nicholls with creative direction by Diti Katona, showcases the potential of the fabrics available. The typeface used is an early version of Carnation, a display face exploring Fred Smeijers’ stencil approach to letter construction, which uses a limited number of shapes as the starting point for an entire alphabet. 

Completed in 2015 for Concrete, with Diti Katona, photography by Chris Nicholls.
