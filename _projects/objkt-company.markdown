Visual identity designed for Objkt Company. In addition to the overall visual identity, the scope of work included developing packaging for a new product created with professional audio engineers in mind. *Cable Gear* aims to solve the inherent problems in managing large amounts of cables. Other products exist on the market, but when multiple *Cable Gear*s are used as a system, they behave as an open conduit making it easy to add or remove cables at any point. A set of symbols was developed to visually reinforce the idea of an open system, inspired by the notation of electric components in circuit design (resistors, capacitors, transistors). 

Includes identity, packaging for 3 Ã— Gears, silk screen printed business card and postcard, shipping materials and website. Completed in 2016 with Clea Forkert and photography by Daniel Ehrenworth.
