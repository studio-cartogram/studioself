Identity, packaging and website design created for Objkt Company. Craig Marshall approached us to brand and package a new product he had developed with professional audio engineers in mind. Cable Gear aims to solve the inherent problems in managing large amounts of cables. Other products exist on the market, but when multiple Cable Gears are used as a system, they behave as an open conduit making it easy to add or remove cables at any point. A set of symbols was developed to use as a visual description of the open system, inspired by the notation of electric components in circuit design (resistors, inductances, capacitors, transistors). 

Includes packaging for 3 Ã— Gears, silk screen printed business card and postcard, shipping materials and e-commerce website. Completed in 2016 with Clea Forkert; photography by Daniel Ehrenworth.
