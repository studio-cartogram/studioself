Identity, packaging and website design for Objkt Company. Craig Marshall approached us to brand and package a new product he had developed with professional audio engineers in mind. Cable Gear aims to solve the tremendous headaches involved with managing large amounts of cables. Other products exist on the market, but when used together the Cable Gears behave as an open conduit, making it easy to remove or add cables at any point in the system. A set of symbols was developed to use as a visual description of the open system, inspired by the notation of electric components in circuit design (resistors, inductances, capacitors, transistors). 

Completed in 2016, with Clea Forkert, photography by Daniel Ehrenworth.
