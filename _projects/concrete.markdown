Packaging created for Concrete’s annual holiday gift, a bottle of wine mailed to clients, suppliers, colleagues and friends. Each year a different designer is asked to create the card that accompanies the wine, but due to larger production minimums the boxes were used for several seasons. Previously, the wine boxes were unnecessarily packaged in a second box for delivery. The need for redundant packaging was eliminated by using a heavy flute of corrugated cardboard (an off the shelf shipping material) for the wine box itself.

Measures 4 × 4 × 14 inches, corrugated cardboard with a double hit of opaque white silkscreen. Created in 2014 for Concrete with John Pylypczak and Diti Katona. Awarded by the Type Directors Club and Graphis in 2014 and 2016.
