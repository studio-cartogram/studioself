Packaging designed for Concrete’s annual holiday gift of wine and chocolate, mailed to clients, suppliers, colleagues and friends. Each year a different designer is asked to create the card that accompanies the gift, but due to larger production minimums, the box is used for several seasons. Previously, the wine boxes were packaged again in another shipping box to de delivered, which seemed unnecessary. By using an off the shelf shipping material like a heavy flute of corrugated cardboard, the wine box and shipping box become the same.

4 × 4 × 14 inches, corrugated cardboard with a double hit of opaque white silkscreen. Created in 2014 for Concrete, with John Pylypczak and Diti Katona. Awarded by the Type Directors Club and Graphis in 2014 and 2016.
