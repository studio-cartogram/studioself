Naming, identity and packaging design for St. Malo Fine Foods, a specialty cooking oil producer based in Taiwan and Canada. Offering premium avocado and organic canola oil, luxury packaging was designed for the Asian market and gifting in particular. 

The name was suggested as a way of linking two locations: the port city of St. Malo in Brittany, northwest France, and the town the bears its name in the prairies of Canada.
By referencing the two, the well reputed European sources of the brandâ€™s avocado and olive oil are connected to the agricultural heritage of Canadian canola oil.

Includes 1 Litre and 500 mL bottle packaging, a premium double package, and a 32 page saddle stitched booklet, featuring nutritional information and recipes. Completed in 2016 for Concrete.
