Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? Chickens don't clap! Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. Let me out that Queen. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! One for the ladies. What have we always said is the most important thing?
