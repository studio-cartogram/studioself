Catalogue design for Renee Green’s exhibition *Endless Dreams And Time-Based Streams* at the Yerba Buena Center For The Arts in San Francisco, California. In addition to *Endless Dreams*, an older body of work never exhibited in North America, *United Spaces of Conditioned Becoming* was also shown. This small but extensive volume attempts to capture the complexity of Green’s various time-based art installations which encompass video, audio as well as more conventional static artworks and collected ephemera. A visual index of the artworks exhibited attempts to catalogue older works as they reappear in the context of newer ones, and the standard exhibition catalog checklist instead becomes a system of visual footnotes throughout the book. With contributions by Betti-Sue Hertz, Lisa Gangitano, Ros Gray and Lisa Le Feuvre. 

6 × 9 inches, 144 pages, soft cover with dust jacket. ISBN-13: 978-0982678909. Completed in 2010 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.
