Identity, naming, signage and printed materials for Elte Market, a new retail space by Elte, a well known furniture and homewares retailer in Toronto. Using the store's location as a starting point, a repurposed industrial space, the logo and identity simply references the visual language of the factory. Stencil typography, hand painted signage, and raw materials like wood, cardboard and cork all reinforce the connection to industrial materials, prefabrication and mass production. A connection to furniture is drawn by using a particular stencil typeface, typically featured on the architectural drawings and printed materials of legendary mid-century architects and designers like Le Corbusier, Jean Prouv√©, and Serge Mouille.

Completed in 2013 for Concrete, with John Plypczak and Jordan Poirier.
