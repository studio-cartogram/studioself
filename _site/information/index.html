    <p>Studio Self is the graphic design practice of Matthew Boyd, a Toronto based graphic designer and art director. I design books, identities, websites, typefaces and packaging for commercial and cultural clients alike. My practice is centred around the creation of thoughtful work that is rich in detail and meaning. My approach is based around discussion, research and exploration, and always involves close collaboration with my clients and partners. My wish is to work with people who are engaged with their audience so that together we can create work that communicates with a clear purpose, sincerely and directly.</p>

<p>I have over 12 years of experience, working for large and small clients in many different areas. Most recently I held the position of Design Director at Concrete, where I lead branding and packaging projects for a wide range of clients, always with a focus on critical details, typography and materials. Previously I was a founding partner of the studio Way Shape Form, which focused on the design of publications, printed materials and packaging for museums, publishers and record labels, among others. My work has been recognized internationally by organizations like the Type Directors Club (US), Graphis (CH), and the ADCC (CN), and has been included in exhibitions and publications such as Graphic (KR). I hold a BFA in Graphic Design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>I am always interested in new and exciting projects and collaborations. If you think that your project could benefit from my participation in any way, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.</p>
