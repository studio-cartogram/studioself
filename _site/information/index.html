    <p>Matthew Boyd is a graphic designer and art director, based in Toronto, Canada. I am engaged in the design of books, identities, websites and packaging for commercial and cultural clients. My practice is centred around the creation of thoughtful work that is simultaneously rich with detail and easily understood. My process involves discussion, research and exploration, so that I may gain insight into, and find a solution for, the goals of any assignment.</p>

<p>I have over 12 years of experience, working for large and small clients in many different areas. Most recently I held the position of Design Director at Concrete, where I lead branding and packaging projects for a wide range of clients, always with a focus on critical details, typography and materials. Previously I was a founding partner of the studio Way Shape Form, which focused on the design of publications, printed materials and packaging for museums, publishers and record labels. I hold a BFA in Graphic Design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. My work has been recognized internationally by organizations like the Type Directors Club (US), the One Club (US), Graphis (CH), and the ADCC (CAN), and has been included in publications such as Graphic (KOR).</p>

<p>My wish is to work with clients who are engaged with their audience so that I may create work that communicates as clearly and effectively as possible. I am always on the look out for new and exciting projects and collaborations. If you think that your project could benefit from my participation in any way, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in contact.</p>
