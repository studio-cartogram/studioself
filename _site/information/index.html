    <p>Matthew Boyd is an independent graphic designer and art director with over 12 years of experience. As Design Director Matthew leads projects for a wide range of clients, always with a focus on critical details, typography and materials. He currently works on a wide range of branding, packaging, and print projects for clients including Keilhauer, Pusateri’s, Great Gulf, and Cérvelo.</p>

<p>Design is simultaneously a process and a result, a business tool and an art form, a service and a product. With this in mind I create visual concepts and identities that may result in, or be applied to; books, catalogues, posters, flms, stationaries, websites and packaging. My work is based on discussion, insight and intuition. My wish is for my clients, my partners and myself to be within the target group of what we are creating, so that we can build our work on what we ask for as an audience.</p>

<p>Matthew graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Before joining Concrete he ran an independent practice and worked with artists, publishers, entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes. Some of his previous clients include Nike, Vans, Now-Again Records, J&amp;L Books, and The Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts. His work has been recognized internationally and his work has been included in publications such as Graphic (Korea). I am always on the look out for new and exciting projects and collaborations. If you think that your project could benefit from my participation in any way, I will be happy to talk to you.</p>
