    <p>Record packaging designed for The Natural Yogurt Band’s only North American
reissue of their album Away With Melancholy, released on Now-Again Records. This
diffcult to categorize album is heavily infuenced by Galt MacDermot, David Axelrod,
and Ennio Morricone, as well as library music. Library music, sometimes known as
mood music, was made exclusively for use in television and radio commercials, and
never made available for sale to the public. The cover of Away with Melancholy
references the abstract, psychedelic, and often anonymous looking sleeves of library
records.</p>

<p>Includes 2 × 10 inch LP and CD. Completed in 2009 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way
Shape Form.</p>
