&lt;p&gt;Record packaging designed for The Natural Yogurt Band’s only North American reissue of their album Away With Melancholy, released on Now-Again Records. This difficult to categorize album is heavily influenced by Galt MacDermot, David Axelrod, and Ennio Morricone, as well as library music. Library music, sometimes known as mood music, was made exclusively for use in television and radio commercials, and never made available for sale to the public. The cover of Away with Melancholy references the abstract, psychedelic, and often anonymous looking sleeves of library records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes 2 × 10 inch LP and CD. Completed in 2009 with River Jukes-Hudson for Way Shape Form.&lt;/p&gt;
